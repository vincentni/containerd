This tailored containerd is based on upstream [containerd@v1.7.3](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/tree/v1.7.3).

containerd is an industry-standard container runtime with an emphasis on simplicity, robustness, and portability. It is available as a daemon for Linux and Windows, which can manage the complete container lifecycle of its host system: image transfer and storage, container execution and supervision, low-level storage and network attachments, etc.

containerd is a member of CNCF with ['graduated'](https://landscape.cncf.io/?selected=containerd) status.

containerd is designed to be embedded into a larger system, rather than being used directly by developers or end-users.
